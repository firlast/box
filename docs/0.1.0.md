## Installation

You can install Box version control with the `pip` package manager:

```
pip install box
```

Or, if you prefer, clone the official repository of the project and perform the manual installation by running the `setup.py` script. Here:

```
git clone https://github.com/firlast/box.git
cd box/
python3 setup.py install
```

## Box Setup

After installing Box, you need to define your name and email address that will be used in a commit's author information. This information will be visible to anyone using the `log` command. To do this we use the `config` command. Here is an example:

```
box config --name "Jaedson Silva" --email "mail@mail.com"
```

You can also change just the name or just the email with this command, just use the `--name` or `--email` flag.
